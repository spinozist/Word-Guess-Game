HANGMAN --

    1. Select a word to match at random
        - (or perhaps accept one?)
    2. Receive user input to guess containing letters
    3. If contained, reveal in DOM
    3b. If not, save to list and pass
    4. Once all containing letters are guessed, game over.

    Extra: 
    - How many guesses should there be?
    - How can you enforce guesses and win/lose logic?
    - How can you remove redundancy in the code?
